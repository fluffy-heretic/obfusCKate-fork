# PoD + obfusCKate compatibility patch

What this mod does:

- Merge all the GUI edits from both mods
- Merge all the edits to schemes and feasts from both mods
- Hide WoD lore buttons, resonance (from Scry the Soul), or Ventrue feeding compatibility from the character window, unless you know the character well
- Also hide Inventory buttons unless you know the character well
- Hide Coterie stats

What this mod DOESN'T do:

- Add any new mechanics, like supernatural abilities to spy on other characters. This is just a compatibility patch
- Filter POD traits when viewing acquaintances
- Fix pre-existing bugs and error log spam from obfusCKate

Compatible with the Princes of Darkness dev build (as of December 29th 2023), and obfusCKate 13.1.

- Princes of Darkness dev build: https://github.com/PrincesOfDarknessMod/princesofdarknessmod-for-ck3
